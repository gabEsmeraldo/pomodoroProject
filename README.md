# pomodoroProject
Pomodoro Timer for Studies made during my vacation from college, meant to be minimalistic, simple, and yet, pleasant to the eye.
## Technologies
We decided to not overcomplicate this, deciding then to use Html, JS and Css for the project.
### Hosted on vercel for ease of use on our side.
Didn't want to bother using AWS to host a simple project like that.
## TODO?
Another functionalities that may be added on the future, if i decide to work on this project again:
- [ ] Electron/Tauri version for desktop taskbar.
- [ ] Sounds for timer state change.
- [ ] Customizability - Wallpaper, Sounds.
